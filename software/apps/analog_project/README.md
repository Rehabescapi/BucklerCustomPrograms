Analog Accelerometer App
========================

Reads data from the [ADXL327](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL327.pdf)
analog accelerometer. To see output run `make rtt`

nRF SAADC (Successive Approximation Analog to Digital Converter) [API documentation]( https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.1.0%2Fgroup__nrfx__saadc.html)




Things completed.
Groc enough of the angle math. 
Groc the Angle math.. With Vivien. Finished Phi, psi and degree from a flat position.




Things todo.



Format for data .-- Given by the instructor


Create Data stream to write to a file. --- Assignment given by Instructor. 


Set up the I/O to memory Stick. --Given by the instructor. 







Implement a function that when called gives the inclination angle about any of the three axes. (10 marks)
a). Use the principle of operation to determine the inclination/tilt angle of forearm* as it flexes from mean position to an extreme. (20 marks)
b).** Use the accelerometer to measure the leg angle during one gait cycle (time between two foot touchdowns on a single leg). Use the coin cell battery to power the board and SD card to collect the data. (20 marks)
